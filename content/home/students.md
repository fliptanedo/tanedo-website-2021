I am one of the faculty in the [UCR particle theory](https://theory.ucr.edu) group. I also work with some of the theory faculty in the [UCR astro group](https://astro.ucr.edu).

{{% callout note %}}
I am not currently taking new Ph.D students until at least Fall 2022. <small>Prospective UCR students should reach out to discuss expectations of studentship before accepting any offer.</small>

UCR undergraduates seeking mentoring in particle physics (e.g. through [NMC](https://www.aps.org/programs/minorities/nmc/) or [CL](https://www.cientificolatino.com)) may [contact me](#contact). I welcome invitations for potential postdocs eligible for the [UC PPFP](https://ppfp.ucop.edu/info/) fellowship, NSF MPS ASCEND fellowship, or a [UC-MEXUS](https://alianzamx.universityofcalifornia.edu/research-and-innovation/uc-mexus-conacyt-doctoral-fellow-program/) fellowship.
