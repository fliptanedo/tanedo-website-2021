[**Ambigrams**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambigram) are images that spell out a word and that are identical under a discrete transformation, typically a half-cycle rotation. They were invented by Douglas Hofstadter---of *GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach* fame---and I suspect I first was introduced to ambigrams by the writings of [Martin Gardner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gardner), perhaps his *Aha! Gotcha* book that was one of my favorites as a child.

In December 2018 I sketched out my own ambigram using [Procreate](https://procreate.art) on an iPad. I finalized the design using [Affinty Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/) and have since used the design as a personal logo. The design lends itself to vinyl stickers to place on my electronic devices.

My ambigram is not a pure ambigram since the `f` and the `p` are slightly asymmetric based on which leg goes under the other.
