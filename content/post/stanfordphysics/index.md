I enjoyed the t-shirt culture of student groups at Stanford during my time there in the early 2000s. One of my favorite t-shirt designs was this one for the Society of Physics Students.

At the time it took me forever to clip the Feynman diagram path so that the `S` could be placed inside the loop. We must have splurged on this design since the print included three colors.  

If I were to do this again, I would have replaced the `S` with a tree. Perhaps the [Stanford Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Tree).
